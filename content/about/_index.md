CamFlow stands for **Cam**bridge information **Flow** architecture, the Cam is also the river that flows through Cambridge, UK.
CamFlow is a [Linux Security Module](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/LSM.txt) (LSM) designed to capture data provenance for the purpose of system audit.
The whole-system provenance capture mechanism is highly configurable, and can fit the needs of many different type of applications.
CamFlow can stack with existing security modules such as [SELinux](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/ch-selinux).
