People do their best work when they are both challenged and happy. Research provides plenty of intellectual challenge; our project culture is designed to encourage happiness.

### We are open and collaborative
We value diversity in all dimensions, welcoming students and collaborators of all genders, orientations, races, and religions.
We collaborate within the project and with colleagues outside the project.

### We are positive
Feedback is critical to the research enterprise.
However, feedback can take many forms – we welcome constructive criticism. We criticize ideas, not people.
We criticize with respect.
We are open to others’ perspectives. We do not always agree, but when we disagree, we do so collegially and respectfully.

### We are supportive
Each of us shares in the mission to enable every member of our project to achieve their greatest potential, realizing that each person’s definition of success is highly personal.
We support each other in realizing our individual images of success.
We do not tolerate personal attacks and discrimination of any kind.
