We are exploring means to formally model the provenance generated by CamFlow capture system.
This is achieved by performing static analysis of the kernel source code.
We have made available the models corresponding to [LSM hooks](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-dev/blob/master/docs/HOOKS.md) and [system calls](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-dev/blob/master/docs/COVERAGE.md).
The models are also available in raw [dot format](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-dev/tree/master/docs/dot).
An early description of the process is described in our [CCS'18 paper](./publications/ccs-2018.pdf).
