The output generated by [camflowd](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflowd) supports two formats: [W3C PROV-JSON](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2013/SUBM-prov-json-20130424/) format and the [SPADE JSON](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE/wiki/Reporting-provenance-using-JSON) format.

{{% block note %}}
The W3C PROV output is not a single JSON object, but rather a collection of objects each representing an arbitrary sub-part of the graph.

SPADE JSON is CamFlow default output. One can change this setting by [modifying camflowd configuration](http://localhost:1313/#recording).
