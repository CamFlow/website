There are three main options covered below for how to install CamFlow:
1. using your favorite package manager on Fedora;
2. building the kernel on the local machine; or
3. using [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to set up a virtual machine.

This is an academic project. While CamFlow is actively maintained, an operating system
is a complex environment with a multitude of moving parts and our resources are limited.
CamFlow is mostly tested in virtualized environment and we do not have the resources
for extensive test.
Please, get in touch with

if you encounter any issue.
