The team behind [SPADE](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/gehani/papers/MW-2012.SPADE.pdf) at [SRI](http://www.csl.sri.com/people/gehani/) have worked on a SPADE reporter for CamFlow.
It allows to ingest CamFlow generated data at runtime or from audit traces stored on disk.
Please, visit SPADE's [website](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE/wiki/Collecting-system-wide-provenance-on-Linux-with-CamFlow) for further instructions.

We are providing a [vagrantfile](https://github.com/CamFlow/vagrant/tree/master/spade) to easily experiment with SPADE-CamFlow integration.
Please do report any issues to the [SPADE](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE/issues) and [CamFlow](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-dev/issues) teams.
